This can be achieved by:&#xA;&#xA;* Abusing device owner permissions to perform silent uninstallation using device owner API calls.&#xA;* Abusing root permissions to delete files from the filesystem.&#xA;* Abusing the accessibility service. This requires an intent be sent to the system to request uninstallation, and then abusing the accessibility service to click the proper places on the screen to confirm uninstallation."

    <externals xsi:type="TRADES:ExternalThreat" xmi:id="_MkoWDVAAEeuuOpuVoWXn6A" name="Web Service" ID="T1481" Description="Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying commands to a compromised system.&#xA;&#xA;These commands may also include pointers to command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.&#xA;&#xA;Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.&#xA;&#xA;Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed)."
